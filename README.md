# Getting-started

Fulcrum app to parse end dates. 


## Running Locally

This script will build a json file for you called "studentsParsed.json" with the
required data. 

You can copy the data over and look at it here http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/

```sh
1 - Clone the repo here: https://github.com/Dansajjad/fb-getDates
2 - Run npm install from root folder
3 - Add the rawJSON file to the root folder 
4 - Run node functions.js from inside the root folder
```
